# Noise-Gate-on-Python-Using-Librosa
Overview
This Python script demonstrates how to implement a noise gate using the Librosa library. A noise gate is a signal processing technique used to reduce the level of audio signals below a certain threshold. In this implementation, the script loads an audio file, analyzes its spectrogram, identifies noisy frames based on a given threshold, and filters out the noise to produce a cleaner audio signal.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Librosa library (can be installed via pip: pip install librosa)
NumPy library
Usage
Install the required dependencies if not already installed.
Adjust the audio_path variable to point to the location of the audio file you want to process.
Set the threshold variable to a suitable value according to the level of noise in your audio file. This threshold determines the point below which frames are considered noise.
Run the script.

Functionality
Load Audio: The script loads the audio file specified by audio_path using Librosa.
Compute STFT: Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) is computed to convert the audio signal into its frequency domain representation.
Calculate Magnitude Spectrogram: Magnitude spectrogram is calculated from the STFT to represent the distribution of frequency components over time.
Compute Frame-wise Energy: The frame-wise energy of the audio signal is computed using Librosa's rms function.
Apply Noise Gate: Frames with energy above the specified threshold are identified as noisy frames.
Create Binary Mask: A binary mask is created to separate noisy frames from the audio signal.
Apply Mask to Magnitude Spectrogram: The binary mask is applied to the magnitude spectrogram to filter out noise.
Reconstruct Filtered Audio: The filtered magnitude spectrogram is transformed back into the time domain using inverse STFT to obtain the cleaned audio signal.
Example
An example usage of the script is provided at the bottom of the script. Simply replace the audio_path variable with the path to your desired audio file, and adjust the threshold value accordingly.

Notes
It's essential to fine-tune the threshold parameter based on the specific characteristics of your audio data to achieve optimal noise reduction without sacrificing desired signal components.
This script provides a basic implementation of a noise gate and may require further customization for specific use cases or advanced noise reduction techniques.
