# Noise-Gate-on-Python-Using-Librosa
Overview
This Python script demonstrates how to implement a noise gate using the Librosa library. A noise gate is a signal processing technique used to reduce the level of audio signals below a certain threshold. In this implementation, the script loads an audio file, analyzes its spectrogram, identifies noisy frames based on a given threshold, and filters out the noise to produce a cleaner audio signal.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
Librosa library (can be installed via pip: pip install librosa)
NumPy library

#Usage
1) Install the required dependencies if not already installed.
2) Adjust the audio_path variable to point to the location of the audio file you want to process.
3) Set the threshold variable to a suitable value according to the level of noise in your audio file. This threshold determines the point below which frames are considered noise.
4) Run the python script(python noise_gate.py).


#Functionality
1) Load Audio: The script loads the audio file specified by audio_path using Librosa.
2) Compute STFT: Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) is computed to convert the audio signal into its frequency domain representation.
3) Calculate Magnitude Spectrogram: Magnitude spectrogram is calculated from the STFT to represent the distribution of frequency components over time.
4) Compute Frame-wise Energy: The frame-wise energy of the audio signal is computed using Librosa's rms function.
5)Apply Noise Gate: Frames with energy above the specified threshold are identified as noisy frames.
6) Create Binary Mask: A binary mask is created to separate noisy frames from the audio signal.
7) Apply Mask to Magnitude Spectrogram: The binary mask is applied to the magnitude spectrogram to filter out noise.
8) Reconstruct Filtered Audio: The filtered magnitude spectrogram is transformed back into the time domain using inverse STFT to obtain the cleaned audio signal.
   
#Example
An example usage of the script is provided at the bottom of the script. Simply replace the audio_path variable with the path to your desired audio file, and adjust the threshold value accordingly.

#Notes
* It's essential to fine-tune the threshold parameter based on the specific characteristics of your audio data to achieve optimal noise reduction without sacrificing desired signal components.
* This script provides  implementation of a noise gate and may require further customization for specific use cases or advanced noise reduction techniques.
